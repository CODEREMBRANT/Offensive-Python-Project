There is simple Server-Client program. 
Client is trojan payload. 
Server has both GUI and CLI interfaces.



installation:
-------------
  YOU NEED ALL 3 rar ARCHIVES --> unpack it in one big file
  I used pyarmor to obfuscate the code, but there is also a non-obfuscated code inside this directory that is detectable by AV

  You have 2 versions of client payload:
    1. Init. packed client with another packer as persistence payload (IExpress package inside IExpress package)
    2. Init. packed client with EXE file as persistence payload
